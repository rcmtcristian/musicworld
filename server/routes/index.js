// This file references all of your different routers into one router to be used by our controllers

// Require Dependencies
const path = require('path')
const router = require('express').Router()

// Require your router directory here ================

// You need to require all of the routers that are being exported from each file here
// The below example is for all of your API routes. Since we are using React,
// there is little need for an '/html' file so for the most part, you can just leave this file be
// and move on to the api directory.

// Example:
const apiRoutes = require('./api')

// ===================================================

// Tell the express router to use your routes here====

// Example:
router.use('/api', apiRoutes)
// Your API has now picked up '/api' as a reference to the file
// For more information about how this api is set up, please reference README.md

// ===================================================

// When an unknown route is hit, send the React app
// If application is in production,
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Send build index.html
  router.use(function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../../client/build/index.html'))
  })
} else {
  // else if the application is in development,
  // Send the public index.html
  router.use(function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../../client/public/index.html'))
  })
}

// Exports Router
module.exports = router
